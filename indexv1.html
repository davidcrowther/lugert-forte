        <p class="question"><strong>Q.</strong>  Do you want to spend a good chunk of your paycheck on it?</p>
        <p class="question"><strong>Q.</strong>  Do you want to spend days of frustration trying to learn how to use the jolly thing?</p>
        <div class="answers">
          <p>Most logical people will say, No, they want something affordable (of course with a free trial to ensure it is right for them), and they want something that doesn't take a Microsoft employee to figure out how to use it. Plus,  they want a guarantee...</p>
          <p>However they don't  want to sacrifice the extra features of a professional notation and playback platform.</p>
          <p>This is where Forte cuts through the mix.</p>
